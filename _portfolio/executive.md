## Data Visualization for Decision Making

**This section is under construction so I apologize for the mess!**

These graphics showcase examples of data & schematic visualization for strategic decision makers.&nbsp;  Although many tools currently exist  for organizing & displaying information, there are many situations where you may need to combine the functionality of two or more such tools in order to see the bigger picture.&nbsp;  These situations merit customized visualization so that everybody on your team can understand ***all*** of the relevant variables effecting key decisions, rather than some parochial subset of such variables.&nbsp;

# Timelines

Gnatt charts are often one of the least favorite and yet most essential visual aids in project management.&nbsp;  The customized Gnatt chart below summarizes data that I would normally track in both Microsoft Project & Excel:

In the example above, we have a hypothetical project in which a firm is developing an embedded system with the printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) design in house, coupled with fabrication, software & field testing all being contracted to third parties.&nbsp;  The firm's leadership is most concerned with tracking monies spent on those contractors.&nbsp; They are concerned about not only tracking what they are getting in terms of deliverables received, but also monitoring the monthly cash burn in terms of the monies allotted to this project as a whole.

The firm's product phase gate scheme is laid out on top of the graphic.&nbsp;  The firm's tasks & milestones have a blue-green (cool-color) scheme while contractors & materials have a read-yellow-orange (warm color) scheme for contrast.&nbsp;

# Conceptual Modeling

Below is an example of a conceptual model.&nbsp;  Conceptual models have been popular in academia for half a century and are now being used in the business world as well.&nbsp;  They illustrate the relationships between variables in a complex system without necessarily quantifying any of those variables, and often serve as a stepping stone to building [financial models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_modeling) and other business intelligence tools.&nbsp;  Conceptual models clarify tradeoffs between competing priorities of engineers, sales representatives, and business developers so that stakeholders gain a 'satellite view' of the situation.

The conceptual model above explains the problem of adhering to Department of Defense (DoD) doctrine when training ground forces for a combat deployment.&nbsp;  In 2012, the DoD's Army Infantry doctrine called for several troop movements to be used in Afghanistan such as the [platoon column](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-21-9/chap3.htm#fig3-2) with [fireteam wedges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_wedge),  and while this formation theoretically provided the best chances for victory in a firefight, it led to several soldiers missing in action because they got tired, and stopped paying attention to what direction the group was traveling in.&nbsp;

This angered brigade commanders who ordered their patrols to use a much simpler [file formation](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-21-9/chap3.htm#fig3-7) instead, and while this enabled tired & weary soldiers to follow the person in front of them with minimal brainpower, it made returning fire to the enemy much more difficult and lead to confusion in battle.&nbsp;

If they had spent more time training on how to return fire while in the file formation back home, that is, had they used tactics that were easier to perform then those of the more optimized DoD tactics, they could've prevented casualties in the battlespace.&nbsp;  Unfortunately, this lesson is learned anew each time the United States enters a new war.&nbsp;
