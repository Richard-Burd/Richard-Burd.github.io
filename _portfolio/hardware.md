## Hardware Design Page
Below are some examples of my professional and personal design projects that are basically not software related, and thus, I'm calling them all 'hardware' since nowadays I primarily develop software.

A while back a debate raged on whether or not to adopt [multirotor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multirotor) airframes for civilian UAV applications in agriculture or to stick with the simpler, more reliable fixed wing configuration.&nbsp;  This airframe explored the possibilities of using low-aspect ratio planforms combined with high-camber airfoils to achieve very steep landing trajectories with a rigid airframe that could handle the impact of such a landing.&nbsp;

This airframe is a flying crash-test dummy used to carry a UAV's electronic systems on a test flight without having to worry about damaging the electronics in the event of a crash.&nbsp;  This airframe was humorously inefficient but saved thousands of dollars in what otherwise could've been catastrophic crashes.&nbsp;

The TestWing above was eventually re-configured into the PeshWing below and actually performed pretty well in terms of crash suitability and flight endurance.&nbsp;

I am a big 3D printing nerd and love to make all sorts of 3D printed mechanical widgits on my [MakerBot](https://www.makerbot.com/).&nbsp;  This is a GoPro camera mount that features a servo-actuated pan capability for carriage on small UAV's.&nbsp;

3D printing entire airframes was unfortunately cost prohibitive and brought with it significant weight penalties.&nbsp;  This meant using off the shelf airframes to build our systems on and carry or cameras.&nbsp;  Here I have made modifications in the form of taping shut the existing [elevon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevon) control surfaces and expanding the wing area by adding on my own.&nbsp;  These *'elevon extensions'* provided more surface area needed at higher angles of attack that allowed for lower takeoff & landing speeds.&nbsp;  The cruising attitude also saw reduced [AoA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_attack) and thus we got extended flight times as well.&nbsp; This approach would normally incur a weight penalty on a full-scale aircraft built out of wood or aluminum, but at this particular scale, the extra weight of the elevon extensions was negligible.

My professional career began in architecture where I designed floor plans and coordinated with electrical, mechanical, and plumbing engineers as well.&nbsp;  The link below has some excerpts from construction documents I produced.&nbsp;
