A few of my fellow students at [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/) asked me recently if I had anything that would show how Redux works without involving React at all.&nbsp;  Learning React & Redux together, before understanding how they both work alone, is not recommended   .&nbsp; A while back I watched a [React-less tutorial on Redux here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sjMRS1gJys) published by Steven Grider so I could wrap my head around Redux.  The quick-reference study guide I produced while watching that video is here below...enjoy!
