I"˜<p>Before starting this portfolio project, I began a paradigm shift away from illustrating whole programs to just illustrating the general frameworks they were written in.  The idea is, if we can graphically conceptualize the framework in a single illustration, we can recycle that illustration and use it on multiple projects.  From the outset of this portfolio project, I coded in an ambitiously complex set of object models to see if I could get them to collaborate properly. Although this project allowed me to explore Active Recordâ€™s abilities in depth, the stringent requirements for restful routes limited my abilities to refactor my controllers and views.  This was partly due to me using the more complex <em>slugging</em> of objects in the URLs rather than using object IDâ€™s, but also due to another fundamental limitation: our use of Sinatra did not explore the abstracting-out of embedded Ruby code.</p>
