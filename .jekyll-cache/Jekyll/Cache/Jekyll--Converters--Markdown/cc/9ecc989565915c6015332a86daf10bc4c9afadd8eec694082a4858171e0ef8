      Throughout my professional career, I have honed a skill I refer to as <a href="../consulting" target="blank" style="color: #2471a3 ;"><u><i>schematic visualization.</i></u></a>  This entails crafting drawings that convey intricate information to individuals who might otherwise find it incomprehensible. In the past, I have utilized these drawings to brief generals and civilian C-suite executives, harmonize various engineering disciplines on collaborative projects, and document design work for clearer comprehension by others.
