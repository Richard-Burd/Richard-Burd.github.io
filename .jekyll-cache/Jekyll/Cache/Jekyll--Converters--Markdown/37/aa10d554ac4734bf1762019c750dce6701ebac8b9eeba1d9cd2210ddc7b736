      My superpower involves what I call <i>data &amp; schematic visualization.</i>  This involves the creation of images &amp; video that explain complex things to many different kinds of people.  I prepare briefings for C-level decision makers, render schematics that synergize multiple engineering disciplines,  and do technical documentation for manufacturers, customers, and internal colleagues.
