I"‹<p>While working on my final project in the online web developer curriculum I encountered more difficulty with Redux than with anything else.Â   The core problem was our requirement to use a central Redux store in order to manage state, while also utilizing a backend Rails API to sent &amp; receive data.Â   I kept thinking to myself: <em>â€˜what do I need this central Redux store for!?â€™</em>   I could just import data to a componentâ€™s state and make the necessary changesâ€¦then at another point in time, when editing some other thing, I could just hit up the server  once again and ask for some fresh data and edit that data accordingly.</p>
