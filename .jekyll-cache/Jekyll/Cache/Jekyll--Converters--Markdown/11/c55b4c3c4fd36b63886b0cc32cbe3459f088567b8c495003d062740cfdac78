      Welcome to my personal website. My name is Richard Burd and I currently work as a front end web developer.  I have a broad professional background that includes leadership, analysis, technical design, and field testing.

    <div class="about-text">
      Over the course of my professional life I have developed a skill that I call <a href="../consulting" target="blank" style="color: #2471a3 ;"><u><i>schematic visualization.</i></u></a>  This involves the creation of drawings that attempt to communicate complex information to people who otherwise would not understand it.  In the past I have used such drawings to brief generals and civilian C-suite decisionmakers, synergize different engineering disciplines (working on the same project) and document design work so it can be better understood by others.  As of late, my interest has shifted from graphics to written text in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering" target="blank" style="color: #2471a3 ;"><u><i>prompt engineering</i></u></a> as a way to better understand complex systems.

      My current interests include AI, aviation, web3, energy policy, and future military conflicts.  In the blockchain space I am particularly interested in oracle networks, trustless transactions, and their potential in the insurance industry.
