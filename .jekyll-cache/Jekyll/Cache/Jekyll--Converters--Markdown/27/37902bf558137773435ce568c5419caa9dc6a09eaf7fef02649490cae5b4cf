<p><strong>This section is under construction so I apologize for the mess!</strong></p>

<p>These graphics showcase examples of data &amp; schematic visualization for strategic decision makers.Â   Although many tools exist on the market for organizing &amp; displaying information, there are often times when you will need to combine the functionality of two or more tools.Â   For example, if youâ€™re using <a href="https://www.solidworks.com/">SolidWorks</a> for mechanical engineering, it can show you what your widget looks like, but what if you want to display regulatory information next to it?Â   What about the software controlling that widget?Â   These situations merit some customized visualization so everybody in your meeting can understand <strong><em>all</em></strong> of the relevant variables effecting the decision, and not some parochial subset of such variables.Â </p>
