I"<p>Until very recently my illustrations have focused on stack architecture and reference guides.   My latest endeavor involves the creation of visual aids that work towards solving the toughest algorithmic problems, that is, I am not looking here to illustrate large code bases involving APIs &amp; multiple stacks, but rather, to illustrate a single algorithm that must solve some sort of difficult problem…and to date, I haven’t really done anything like this.   I am still in the process of creating such a <em>system</em> so I have not yet arrived at a final destination, stay tuned for the final product in a future post. </p>
