<p>Below are some examples of my technical writing and illustration. </p>

<p>The ArduPlane parameter guide is a cheat sheet and checklist used for experimental tinkering with the <a href="https://ardupilot.org/plane/docs/parameters.html">ArduPlane parameters</a>.   It organizes the parameters by functionality so the test pilot can go through and check off each box and write in the value assigned to each one.   The human eye can then scan the page and catch conflicting values within the settings.

<p>I created the first generation user manual for a minimum viable product (MVP) drone system called the <em>Hornet.</em>  The figure below links to a series of excerpts from that document.

<p>Below is an example of one of my software cheat sheets, this one being for TypeScript.   I have a blog post <a href="/the_importance_of_cheat_sheets">here</a> that explains how this document can be used.

<p>The ArduPilot PID Tuning Guide helped engineers &amp; test pilots untangle the intricacies of <a href="https://ardupilot.org/plane/docs/common-tuning.html">ArduPilot PID tuning</a> before the <a href="https://ardupilot.org/plane/docs/automatic-tuning-with-autotune.html">autotune</a> feature was introduced.

<p>This <em>Airfoil Design &amp; Transfer</em> document records a multi-step process of importing accurate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airfoil">airfoils</a> into the <a href="https://www.x-plane.com/">X-Plane</a> flight simulator’s <a href="https://developer.x-plane.com/manuals/airfoil_maker/">Airfoil Maker</a> program.   This is a critical step in producing accurate flight models of small, unmanned airframes in X-Plane’s <a href="https://developer.x-plane.com/article/creating-a-basic-aircraft-in-plane-maker/">Plane Maker program</a>.   The default practice is to use default airfoils available in Plane Maker, but this is extremely problematic because the airfoil polars will assume <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_number">Reynolds numbers</a> of far larger, manned aircraft, so applying them to a smaller UAV will have the effect of inaccurate lift qualities.

<p>This is the hardware schematic for the PeshWing UAV I <a href="/kurdistan">took with me to Iraqi Kurdistan</a>.   This particular style of <em>cartoon schematic</em> shows what the components look like and it ideal for use by manufacturing technicians and in field manuals.

<p>In the early days of agricultural drone flying, we discovered that clouds could have adverse effects on imaging results.   These drawings show the problem and are also cute &amp; colorful.

<p>I created this cheat-sheet for an architectural firm whose principal &amp; associates have long retired.   The idea here is take <em>only</em> those sections of the building &amp; zoning codes that apply to the <em>types</em> of buildings that firm designs, and organize them into a check list for design review.   This enables the architects to ensure there are no hidden code violations in their preliminary designs, saving them tens of thousands of dollars in costly 11th hour changes.   Throughout my career I have produces countless documents like this that simplify hard-to-remember and detailed information.
