I"T<p>Cheat Sheets are a brain’s best friend.   Our neural pathways are not set up to remember lots of asinine details that are all disjointed from each other.  Instead, we’re optimized to remember lots of little things that are relatable to the bigger things that are somehow relevant to those original little(er) things in a way that makes us not forget them.   When the little things get too numerous to count, and when they’re not essential to even understanding how the bigger things work, we need some help.   This is why pilots have checklists and drivers use maps; we need something extra.</p>

<p>What is the point of me (or you) studying some new programming language or framework unless we’re going to start using it regularly!?   You know you’re just going to forget stuff so why bother at all…right?   The answer I’ve found to be true is this: There are two objectives to learning a new technology of any kind and they are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Understand the big idea(s) of what is going on because you won’t forget it(them) so easily.</li>
  <li>Make a cheat-sheet that not only talks about those big ideas, but also elucidates all of the various details you do not want to store in your limited memory for any serious amount of time.</li>
</ol>

<p>So.
