<p>Below are some examples of my professional and personal design projects that are basically not software related, and thus, Iâ€™m calling them all â€˜hardwareâ€™ since nowadays I primarily develop software.</p>

<p>A while back a debate raged on whether or not to adopt <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multirotor">multirotor</a> airframes for civilian UAV applications in agriculture or to stick with the simpler, more reliable fixed wing configuration.Â   This airframe explored the possibilities of using low-aspect ratio planforms combined with high-camber airfoils to achieve very steep landing trajectories with a rigid airframe that could handle the impact of such a landing.Â

<p>This airframe is a flying crash-test dummy used to carry a UAVâ€™s electronic systems on a test flight without having to worry about damaging the electronics in the event of a crash.Â   This airframe was humorously inefficient but saved thousands of dollars in what otherwise couldâ€™ve been catastrophic crashes.Â

<p>The TestWing above was eventually re-configured into the PeshWing below and actually performed pretty well in terms of crash suitability and flight endurance.Â
