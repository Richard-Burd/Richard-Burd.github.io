I"ˆ<p>The curriculum for the front-end web development module has a lot of discussion about how to set up the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show</code> actions in the Rails controllers.  We even learn how to refactor the information in these controllers using serializes.  One thing I found consistently absent were discussions on how to set up a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">create</code> action within the controllers themselves.  In the Pokemon-Teams-Lab, we learn how to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">destroy</code>, but there is no discussion on how to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">create</code> because of the odd-ball nature of how this lab spawns the actual pokemons; itâ€™s a random process where the user does not choose to define any of the Pokemonâ€™s characteristics, but rather, the Pokemons self-generate their own parameters using some online thingamajig.</p>
