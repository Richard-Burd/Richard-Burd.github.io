I"Ö<p>The basic problem with learning code is that, at some point, there are simply too many pieces &amp; parts to keep track of.  If youâ€™re a visual thinker like me, youâ€™ll often find yourself frustrated that you canâ€™t see some sort of â€˜grand-schemeâ€™ or floor-plan for what is going on in front of you.  Since I work with programmers, I can see how they do things; they have multiple computer monitors on their desk to display five or six collaborating methods (or functions) all at once, and make judgements based on this interface.  The actual workspaces wherein we divvy up classes &amp; methods into separate folders are largely designed (at least in part) to help the programmer make sense of all their code.</p>
