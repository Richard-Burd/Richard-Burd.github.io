Iâ€™ve been redacting this project <a href="https://github.com/Richard-Burd/front-end-portfolio-project">here</a> so as to slowly convert the whole thing from being written dynamically in JavaScript, to being statically typed in TypeScript.Â   Each time I return to it Iâ€™ve forgotten all of the TypeScript syntax Iâ€™ve ever learned, and even as Iâ€™m writing this, I would fail even the most basic TypeScript coding interview.Â </p>

<p>None of that really matters because I have a cheat sheet; after an hour or so, I can regain all of my TypeScri</p>
