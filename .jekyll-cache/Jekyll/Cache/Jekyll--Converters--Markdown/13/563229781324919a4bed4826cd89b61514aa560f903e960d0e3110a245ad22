<p><strong>This section is under construction so I apologize for the mess!</strong></p>

<p>These graphics showcase examples of data &amp; schematic visualization for strategic decision makers.Â   Although many tools currently exist  for organizing &amp; displaying information, there are many situations where you may need to combine the functionality of two or more such tools in order to see the bigger picture.Â   These situations merit customized visualization so that everybody on your team can understand <strong><em>all</em></strong> of the relevant variables effecting key decisions, rather than some parochial subset of such variables.Â </p>
