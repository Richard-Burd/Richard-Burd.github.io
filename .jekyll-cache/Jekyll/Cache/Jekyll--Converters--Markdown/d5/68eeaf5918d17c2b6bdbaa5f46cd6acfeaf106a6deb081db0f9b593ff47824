      Over the course of my professional life I have developed a system that I call <a href="../consulting" target="blank" style="color: #2471a3 ;"><u><i>schematic visualization.</i></u></a>  This involves the creation of drawings which explain complex things to many different kinds of people.  
      
      
      
      
      I prepare briefings for C-level decision makers, render schematics that synergize multiple engineering disciplines,  and do technical documentation for manufacturers, customers, and internal colleagues.

      Once on-boarded to your team, I will help you reduce tribal knowledge and miscommunication by creating an organized suite of visual aids using Inkscape, a free and open source software product I evangelize and mentor colleagues on how to use. The best way to contact me is with the email address below, I hope to hear from you soon!
