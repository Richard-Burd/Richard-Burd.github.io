<p>These graphics showcase examples of data &amp; schematic visualization for strategic decision makers.   Although many tools currently exist  for organizing &amp; displaying information, there are many situations where you may need to combine the functionality of two or more such tools in order to see the bigger picture.   These situations merit customized visualization so that everybody on your team can understand <strong><em>all</em></strong> of the relevant variables effecting key decisions, rather than some parochial subset of such variables. </p>

<h1 id="timelines">Timelines</h1>
<p>Gnatt charts are often one of the least favorite and yet most essential visual aids in project management.   The customized Gnatt chart below summarizes data that I would normally track in both Microsoft Project &amp; Excel:</p>

</a></p>

<p>In the example above, we have a hypothetical project in which a firm is developing an embedded system with the printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) design in house, coupled with fabrication, software &amp; field testing all being contracted to third parties.   The firm’s leadership is most concerned with tracking monies spent on those contractors.  They are concerned about not only tracking what they are getting in terms of deliverables received, but also monitoring the monthly cash burn in terms of the monies allotted to this project as a whole.</p>

<p>The firm’s product phase gate scheme is laid out on top of the graphic.   The firm’s tasks &amp; milestones have a blue-green (cool-color) scheme while contractors &amp; materials have a read-yellow-orange (warm color) scheme for contrast. </p>

<h1 id="conceptual-modeling">Conceptual Modeling</h1>
<p>Below is an example of a conceptual model.   Conceptual models have been popular in academia for half a century and are now being used in the business world as well.   They illustrate the relationships between variables in a complex system without necessarily quantifying any of those variables, and often serve as a stepping stone to building <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_modeling" target="_blank">financial models</a> and other business intelligence tools.   Conceptual models clarify tradeoffs between competing priorities of engineers, sales representatives, and business developers so that stakeholders gain a ‘satellite view’ of the situation.</p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nz6OLod.jpg" alt="a conceptual model of the DoD tactics problem" />
</a></p>

<p>The conceptual model above explains the problem of adhering to Department of Defense (DoD) doctrine when training ground forces for a combat deployment.   In 2012, the DoD’s Army Infantry doctrine called for several troop movements to be used in Afghanistan such as the squad or <a href="https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-21-9/chap3.htm#fig3-2" target="_blank">platoon column</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_wedge" target="_blank">fireteam wedges</a>.  While this formation theoretically provided the best chances for victory in a firefight, it led to confusion on foot patrols as Soldiers lost sight of one another among crop fields and other obsticles.   In several instances, Soldiers ended up lost and unaccounted for which in turned spawned rescue operations to go find them! </p>

<p>This angered top brass who ordered their patrols to use a much simpler <a href="https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-21-9/chap3.htm#fig3-7" target="_blank">file formation</a> instead, and while this enabled Soldiers to easily follow the person in front of them without becoming disoriented, it made returning fire to the enemy much more difficult and lead to confusion in firefights. </p>

<p>In order to prevent these circumstances, Army leaders could use the diagram above as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Assess how far above or below the Army average their group of Soldiers are in terms of motivation to learn &amp; discipline (<strong><em>v</em></strong>)</li>
  <li>Based on <strong><em>v</em></strong>, estimate the time they need (<strong><em>x</em></strong>) to reach their end goal of <strong><em>p</em></strong>.</li>
  <li>Knowing roughly how much time <strong><em>p</em></strong> will require, determine where they will <em>really</em> end up at the end of their allotted time in the training calendar (<strong><em>t</em></strong>)</li>
  <li>Given that <strong><em>t</em></strong> is probably not going to be a good place to be in terms of combat effectiveness, what modifications (to the DoD doctrine) could be made such that the group is combat effective to the level of <strong><em>u</em></strong>, which is <em>some</em> level of effectiveness greater than <strong><em>t</em></strong></li>
  <li>If ample time is used to reach <strong><em>u</em></strong> and the training material of <strong><em>u</em></strong> is mastered &amp; memorized by the group, then the tactics of <strong><em>u</em></strong> are the default fallback</li>
  <li>With <strong><em>u</em></strong> defined and mastered, what additional material could be learned to reach <strong><em>r</em></strong>?</li>
</ol>

<p>This method may have shown Army leaders in 2012 that they should spend ample time training with the <a href="https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-21-9/chap3.htm#fig3-7" target="_blank">file formation</a> movement and get really good at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHDsQftUzEo" target="_blank">reacting to contact</a> with it.   In this way, they would train in the U.S. exactly as they fight in Afghanistan. </p>

<h1 id="schematic-visualization">Schematic Visualization</h1>

<p>Schematic Visualizations are used to coordinate two or more design disciplines and help business developers understand the product or service being considered.   They differ from ordinary schematics in that they display information specifically for strategic decision makers rather than engineers or manufacturers.  Schematic visualizations can also show multiple design strategies that a team could pursue for a new product or service. </p>
