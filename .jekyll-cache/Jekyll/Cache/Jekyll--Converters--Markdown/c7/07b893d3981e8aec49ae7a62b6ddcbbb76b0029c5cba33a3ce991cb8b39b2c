I"™<p>In the Sinatra module we learn about restful routes and how to properly incorporate an object id number into our appâ€™s URLs.  In this lab <a href="https://learn.co/tracks/full-stack-web-development-v3/sinatra/activerecord/sinatra-playlister">here</a> we encountered a workspace that puts the objectâ€™s name into the URL rather than the objectâ€™s id number.  I thought this was cool and wanted to do the same thing for <a href="https://github.com/Richard-Burd/sinatra-portfolio-project">my Sinatra portfolio project here</a> since I already knew how to use the object id.  What follows is a step-by-step process for anyone who wants to do the same thing.</p>
