I"a<p>Cheat Sheets are a brain’s best friend.   Our neural pathways are not set up to remember lots of asinine details that are all disjointed from each other.  Instead, we’re optimized to remember lots of little things that are relatable to the bigger things that are somehow relevant to those original little(er) things in a way that makes us not forget them.   When the little things get too numerous to count, and when they’re not essential to even understanding how the bigger things work, we need some help.   This is why pilots have checklists and drivers use maps; we need something extra.</p>
