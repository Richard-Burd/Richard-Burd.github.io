I"²<p>For a while now Iâ€™ve been wondering how programmers keep track of all their work when the code theyâ€™re working with is so massive.  It seem the answer is: â€˜frameworks.â€™  Frameworks set up the ground rules so multiple programmers can collaborate on a set of [valid] assumptions, they also disentangle what would otherwise become <em>spaghetti-code</em> wherein one little change in the program somewhere will break the whole thing and force you to chase down bugs for weeks on end.  Best of all, they save time by doing a lot of work for you that several programmers would otherwise have to each do on their own, forcing them to all write the same code over &amp; over again.</p>
