I"ˆ<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>There are times when the big O notation of a programming algorithm will not predict performance the way many developers expect it to.Â   This article attempts to first explain why that is in abstract terms, and then offer a strategy for selecting an optimal algorithm (or multiple algorithms working together) to be implemented in a software build.</em></p>
