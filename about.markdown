      My superpower involves what I call <i>data & schematic visualization.</i>  This involves the creation of images & video that explain complex things to many different kinds of people.  I prepare briefings for C-level decision makers, render schematics that synergize multiple engineering disciplines,  and do technical documentation for manufacturers, customers, and internal colleagues.

      Once on-boarded to your team, I will help you reduce tribal knowledge and miscommunications by creating an organized suite of visual aids using Inkscape, a free and open source software product I evangelize and mentor colleagues on how to use. The best way to contact me is with the email address below, I hope to hear from you soon!
